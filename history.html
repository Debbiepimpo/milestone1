            <h1 class="title">A little bit of the monkees' History </h1>
            <p class="first-text appear">The members of the band were selected among more than 500 young people (among the rejected were musicians who were later famous </br> as Stephen Stills and Danny Hutton, since the producers were more interested in creating a commercial concept
                than having talented musicians </br> to play or compose music, despite this Michael Nesmith managed from the first album to integrate his compositions) that went to the auditions </br> for a television show and records produced by Don
                Kirshner. The show had an irreverent sense of humor, very similar or rather copied to </br> "A Hard Day's Night", the first movie starring The Beatles; besides this only two of them were musicians (Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork) </br>
                and the rest learned to play on the fly, while in their first albums the track was played and composed by the best musicians and composers </br>of the United States like Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Neil Diamond, Tommy Boice and Bobby Hart,
                so there could be no failure in the aspect </br> of success and between 1966 and 1968 there was not.</p>
            <p class="first-text appear">From the first moment the talent of Nesmith was coming to the light and in each disc of the band his compositions were gaining weight, </br> getting to have five songs of his in the disc Headquarters. The rest of the group was also collaborating
                little by little with their own subjects. </br> From the Headquarters album they already had the ability to play the instruments on the disc and they did so. Unfortunately for them </br> The Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
                Band went on sale and they were displaced from number 1 after just one week.
                </br> In addition they undertook next to Jack Nicholson the project of the film "Head", that was a disaster; his program was canceled and soon </br> Michael Nesmith left the band realizing that for its creators the Monkees were only a
                product and nothing more. Later Nesmith would have </br> an interesting solo career and with the First National Band as a precursor of the Country Rock style.</p>
            <p class="first-text appear">Interestingly in this era The Monkees refused to record "Sugar Sugar" and Kirshner to see the possibility of saving the selection and conflicts </br>
                that led to choose the members, created a cartoon group called The Archies, based on the comic strip Archie whose name the song was published.</br>
                "Sugar Sugar" was the biggest success of 1969.</p>
            <p class="first-text appear">The Monkees had blockbusters like "Last train to Clarkville", "I'm a Believer", "She", "I'm Not Your Steepin 'Stone", "A Little Bit Me A Little Bit You",</br>
                "Sweet Young Thing","Look Out Here Comes Tomorrow","Pleasent Valley Sunday","When Loves Come Knockin 'At Your Door","I Wanna Be Free", </br> "Theme Of The Monkees", "Daydream Believer" and in 1986 they met and had another important success
                "That Was Then, This Is Now.</p>
