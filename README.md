   <h1>The Monkees website</h1>

Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is The Monkess' website done entirely for their fans entretainment. The website has 4 diferent areas, where they can find a little bit of history, 
some of the annual tours of the year we are and few pictures and videos with the best songs and best concerts.



<h2>UX</h2>

My goal in the design was to make information accessible on the site redirecting for an extension of information to an external url, while striving for
an animate and simple design. With the combination of yellow, black/grey and black/orange colours I wanted to give a little touche of vintage and colorful appearence on the
website.

<h3>Technologies<h3>

<ul>
<li> HTML5 </li>
<li> CSS3 </li>
<li> Bootstrap </li>


<h2>Features</h3>

This site uses, different HTML files with completly different design on each onee, the grid feature in Bootstrap, with navbar clear and simple and footer can be interactived.
Also the site uses different designs on each part took them from Bootstrap such as jumbotron, Grid structure and caroussel. And I use one common animation library to get some 
animate areas to this site for making it more interested when the users come into it.

<h2>Testing</h2>


This site was tested multiple times as desktop and mobile devices views to make sure is compatible and responsive.

<h2>Deployment</h2>

This site is hosted in GitHub pages, deployed straight away from the master branch.
The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch when I make a new push to the repository.
Also for the site to deploy as it has to be done correctly on GitHub pages, the main page must be named:  `index.html`.
If you want to run ths code locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone`
https://github.com/Debbiepimpo/milestoneproject1.git into your terminal. And in the end, to unlink with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` in your terminal.

<h4>Content</h4>

All content from the main page to the media on this website, it was written by me.

<h4>Media</h4>

The photos used in this site were obtained from the git source given for this milestone project by Code Institute and from google images searching "The Monkees logo".
The videos used on the "Media" part were embed from youtube.

<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>

I received inspiration for this project from bootstrap, from the esamples that Code Institute provides, searching for some little details on `Google`
and `Youtube` tutorials specialy for animation. Also I used `animate.css` for all animation appearence. I took some of the band knowledge from `wikipedia.org` webiste,  
even I've been inspired for the color range I've used by the official The Monkees website and blog with a little touch of vintage.

I also used the Media Query for the collapsed navbar on mobile devices views.
