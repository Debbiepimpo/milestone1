   <h1>The Monkees website</h1>

Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is The Monkees' website done entirely for their fans entertainment. The website has 4 different areas, where they can find a little bit of history, 
some of the annual tours of the year we are and few pictures and videos with the best songs and best concerts.



<h2>UX</h2>

My goal in the design was to make information accessible on the site redirecting for an extension of information to an external URL, while striving for
an animate and simple design. With the combination of yellow, black/grey and black/orange colours I wanted to give a little touch of vintage and colourful appearance on the website.

 All content from the main page to the media on this website were inspired by the age of the band, by listening some of their songs and I want the users being moved to an old
time with the combination of colours, text style and make the pictures fit well with all this due to their vintage appearance.
 Every text was being resumed to make them quick and easy reading with the purpose to not get the users being bored.

This site uses, different HTML files with completely different design on each one, the grid feature in Bootstrap, with navbar clear and simple and footer can be interactive.
Also, the site uses different designs on each part took them from Bootstrap such as jumbotron, Grid structure and carroussel. And I use one common animation library to get some 
animate areas to this site for making it more interested when the users come into it.

This site was tested across multiple browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and on multiple mobile devices like iPhone 5,6,7: Safari and Chrome, Samsung Galaxy
to make sure it was compatible and responsive. This site was also tested multiple times to make sure every link worked and also, all links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'.
Even every single animation was it was desire, all colours matched as it has to be to make the vintage and non-outstanding colours were there when users are on the website.

<h4>Content</h4>

 I took some of the band knowledge from `wikipedia.org` website.

<h4>Media</h4>

The photos used in this site were obtained from the git source given for this milestone project by Code Institute and from google images searching "The Monkees logo".
The videos used on the "Media" part were embed from Youtube.

<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>

I received inspiration for this project from bootstrap, from the examples that Code Institute provides, searching for some little details on `Google`
and `Youtube` tutorials specialy for animation. I've been inspired for the color range that 
I've used by the official The Monkees website and blog with a little touch of vintage.
